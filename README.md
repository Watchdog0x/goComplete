# Go Bash Completion Script

This repository contains a Bash completion script for the Go programming language command-line tools. It provides intelligent auto-completion for Go commands and their various options, making it easier and faster to work with Go from the command line.

## Features

- Comprehensive completion for main Go commands (`build`, `run`, `test`, etc.)
- Subcommand-specific completions (e.g., `go mod init`, `go tool pprof`, etc.)
- Intelligent package name suggestions based on your current workspace
- Workspace-aware completions that adapt to the presence of `go.work` files
- Caching of package lists for improved performance

## Installation

1. Using curl
   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Watchdog0x/goComplete/main/install.sh | sudo bash
   ```

2. Using wget:
   ```bash
   wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Watchdog0x/goComplete/main/install.sh | sudo bash
   ```

## Usage

Once installed, you can start using the Go completion script immediately. Simply start typing a Go command and press Tab to see available completions. For example:

```bash
go bu<Tab>           # Completes to: go build

go mod i<Tab>       # Completes to: go mod init
```
